# SaboteurComp424
Development of a final project for the comp 424 mcGill course

Please, find in mycourses - discussion - Final project a tutorial for the installation of the project.

Update: 23/03:
  Several bug were fixed:
    - the deck has now the good number of map, which is 6 map instead of 4.
    - a problem with the initilization of player's instance of BoardState is fixed.
    - the path to the background image is now better managed, and should work under all OS.
    
The Autoplay class seems in fact to be working  - no update is needed (was simply a problem on my side): just make sure to have everything well compiled (easy on eclipse).

Thank you for your comments and help to spot these mistakes.

Good luck,

Pierre
